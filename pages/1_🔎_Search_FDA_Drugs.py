st.write("""
This is a search engine for FDA approved drugs that allows you to search a drug by its mechanism of action.\
There are two ways to perform a search:
1. Enter a mechanism of action as free text and set a similarity threshold. This method uses the underlying \
semantics of your query to find similar drugs. Higher similarity threshold will return fewer but more \
semantically similar drugs. You can also include or exclude keywords to narrow down the results.
2. Leave the mechanism of action field empty and use the include and exclude keywords to search for drugs.""")

st.success("""
**Why embeddings?** Embeddings are a way to represent text as vectors in a high-dimensional space. They provide a \
nuanced search capability by not strictly adhering to exact terms, enabling users to adjust the similarity threshold \
to explore drugs with related actions. However, it's worth noting that this could increase the chance of \
encountering false positives, as it broadens the search to include a wide array of potentially related things.
